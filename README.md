An Inventory Form for Stock Management using Windows Forms and ADO.NET is a desktop application for managing inventory in a business. This application leverages Windows Forms for the user interface and ADO.NET for database connectivity to perform CRUD operations on stock data.

Key Features:
Product Management: Add, update, view, and delete product information, including product names, IDs, descriptions, stock quantities, and pricing.
Stock Levels: Track available stock levels and set alerts for low inventory.
Database Integration: Use ADO.NET to connect to an SQL database (like SQL Server) for storing and retrieving stock data.
Search and Filtering: Search products by name or filter by category for quick access.
Simple Reporting: Generate reports on stock levels and product movements for better inventory insights.
Tech Stack:
Frontend: Windows Forms for creating a user-friendly graphical interface.
Backend: ADO.NET for data access, enabling seamless interaction with the database.
Database: SQL Server for storing product, stock, and transaction data.
This project is ideal for learning desktop application development with C#, database connectivity using ADO.NET, and fundamental stock management practices.
